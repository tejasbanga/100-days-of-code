# 100 Days Of Code - Log
**Day 1**: December 25,2017\
**Today's progress**: made the twitter button tweet my quote instead of the codepen link\
**Thoughts** : I was stuck on this a long time, the other parts are fine just need to fine tune it and submit it by tommorrow. Hopefully <br/>

**Day 2**: December 26,2017\
**Today's progress**: I finally finished the random quote machine , and i started working on the local weather app.
**Thoughts**: I'm totally new to apis and am still learning them, I'm reading all I can about it. Hopefully I'll understand this concept soon <br/>
