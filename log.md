**Day 3**: December 27,2017 \
**Today's progress**: I started today with learning how to use apis in javascript, and learnt jquery, also made the local weather app work, all it need it some css magic. \
**Thoughts**: I was not sure if I coudl get the local weather app to work but I persevered. Also one more thing while doing the free code camp excercises I had neglected jQuery because it looked too complicated and I stuck to traditional javascript to get my work done, but today I took a course on jQuery on codecademy and was able to appreciate it's awesomeness!!<br/>
