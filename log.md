# 100 Days Of Code - Log
/*### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)
**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

Today's progress: made the twitter button tweet my quote instead of the codepen link
Thoughts : I was stuck on this a long time, the other parts are fine just need to fine tune it and submit it by tommorrow. Hopefully.
